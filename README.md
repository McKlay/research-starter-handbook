## What This Is

This repository contains a full-length, book-style guide designed to help **master’s students, early researchers, and builders** navigate the confusing, fast-moving world of **academic research in computer science**.

It’s not just about writing papers. It’s about:

- Choosing the right topic  
- Finding and reading the right literature  
- Organizing what you learn  
- Writing and publishing with integrity  
- Surviving the research journey from thesis proposal to submission

This handbook was born from experience and is written for those who didn’t get formal training—but are ready to contribute meaningfully to the field.
