# Chapter 15: From Draft to Submission

> *“A research paper isn’t finished when it’s written. It’s finished when it’s submitted—carefully, ethically, and on time.”*

---

## Why This Chapter Matters

You’ve written your paper. You’ve revised based on feedback.  
Now comes the final stretch—turning your draft into a professional, submission-ready manuscript.

But there are still decisions to make:

- Who are the official authors?
- How do you prepare your paper for the submission portal?
- What deadlines matter most?
- What happens after you hit submit?

This chapter guides you through the **final mile of your research paper journey**—with a focus on deadlines, ethics, formatting, and future steps.

## Conceptual Breakdown

**🔹 Set Internal Deadlines (Not Just the Final One)**

Don’t aim for *just* the conference or journal deadline. Plan backwards.

| Task                             | Recommended Deadline Before Submission |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Finish first full draft          | 3–4 weeks before deadline              |
| Advisor or co-author review      | 2–3 weeks before deadline              |
| Final polishing (figures, format)| 1 week before deadline                 |
| Portal submission and checklist  | 2–3 days before deadline               |

> ✅ Always leave buffer time for technical issues (PDF errors, login problems, last-minute edits).

**🔹 Author Order and Contribution Statements**

Who gets listed as authors—and in what order?

General principles:

- **First author** = primary contributor (you, in most thesis cases)  
- **Second/third/etc.** = collaborators, mentors, or supporting researchers  
- **Last author** = often the senior advisor or lab head (in research groups)

Some venues now require a **contribution statement**, e.g., using the **CRediT taxonomy**:

| Role             | Examples                                      |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Conceptualization| Who came up with the research idea?           |
| Methodology      | Who designed the system or experiment?        |
| Writing          | Who wrote the draft? Revised it?              |
| Supervision      | Who advised, reviewed, or mentored?           |

> ⚖️ Be transparent. Ask your advisor about authorship norms in your department or lab.

**🔹 Submission Portals: What to Expect**

Common platforms:

- **EasyChair** – used by many CS conferences  
- **PCS (Precision Conference System)** – used by SIGCHI, SIGCSE, etc.  
- **Editorial Manager / ScholarOne** – used by journals

What you’ll usually need:

- Title, abstract, keywords  
- Full author list and affiliations  
- PDF upload (sometimes ZIP with source files)  
- Conflict of interest declarations  
- Topics or areas for reviewer matching  
- Ethics/disclosure checklist

> 📌 Always double-check: Does your PDF compile correctly? Is it blinded, if required?

---

**🔹 What Happens After Submission**

You’ll usually receive:

- A confirmation email  
- A timeline for reviews and decisions  
- Sometimes: the option to edit metadata before the deadline

Then comes:

1. **Under Review** – wait period (1–3 months typical for conferences)  
2. **Decision Email** – Accept / Minor Revision / Major Revision / Reject  
3. **(Optional) Rebuttal Phase** – respond to reviewer comments  
4. **Camera-Ready Submission** – if accepted, submit final formatted version

> 💡 Keep all files (source code, images, LaTeX, datasets) organized—camera-ready edits are usually under tight time constraints.

## Self-Check Questions

1. Do you have a project timeline leading to your submission deadline?
2. Have you clarified author order and individual contributions?
3. Do you know what submission system your target venue uses?
4. Have you created a checklist of formatting, anonymization (if required), and ethics declarations?

## Try This Exercise

> **Final Submission Checklist Builder**  
> Open a checklist doc and add:

- [ ] Paper complies with formatting/template  
- [ ] PDF compiles with no errors or warnings  
- [ ] Author list is correct and verified  
- [ ] All references are accurate and cited  
- [ ] Ethics, funding, and disclosure forms (if required)  
- [ ] Submission portal account created  
- [ ] Backup copy stored in cloud drive

You’ll thank yourself during deadline week.

## Researcher’s Compass

Finishing the writing is only half the finish line.  
A successful submission means you’ve:

- Followed ethical practices  
- Respected your co-authors and collaborators  
- Met the technical requirements  
- Managed your timeline like a professional

> Every submission, whether accepted or rejected, brings you closer to your goals.  
> Submit with confidence—and start preparing for what comes next.
