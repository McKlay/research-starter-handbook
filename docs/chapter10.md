# Chapter 10: Academic Integrity 101

> *“In research, your name travels with your work. What you publish is not just yours—it’s your reputation.”*

---

## Why This Chapter Matters

Academic research is built on **trust**—trust that your ideas are yours, your citations are accurate, and your results are real.

Integrity is the foundation of the academic community. Every paper you read, cite, or publish is part of a larger conversation built on honesty and respect. Violating these principles can have serious consequences—not just for your reputation, but for your career and the credibility of your field.

But when you're new to research, it’s easy to cross a line without realizing it. Maybe you reused part of a school paper. Maybe you paraphrased a paper too closely. Maybe you submitted the same draft to two venues without knowing the rules.

This chapter is here to make those boundaries **crystal clear**—so you can protect your work, your credibility, and your future opportunities.

By understanding the rules and best practices of academic integrity, you’ll avoid common pitfalls and set yourself up for long-term success. Transparency and respect for others’ work are not just formalities—they are essential habits for every researcher.

## Conceptual Breakdown

**🔹 What Is Academic Integrity in Research?**

It means:

Academic integrity is more than just avoiding plagiarism. It’s about being honest in every aspect of your research: how you collect data, how you analyze results, and how you present your findings. It also means respecting the work of others and contributing to a culture of trust.

- Giving **proper credit** to the ideas, words, and results of others  
- Being **honest** about what is new, reused, or replicated  
- Following the **submission and review rules** of each journal or conference  
- Reporting your methods, data, and results **transparently**

Academic misconduct isn't always malicious. But ignorance is not an excuse.  

If you’re ever unsure about what’s allowed, ask your advisor or check your institution’s guidelines. It’s always better to clarify than to risk a mistake.

**🔹 Plagiarism: The Obvious and the Subtle**

| Type                  | What It Looks Like                                                   |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Direct plagiarism** | Copy-pasting sentences or paragraphs without citation                |
| **Paraphrasing plagiarism** | Rewriting someone’s ideas without giving credit            |
| **Self-plagiarism**   | Reusing your own previous work without disclosure                    |
| **Source misrepresentation** | Citing a paper without actually using or understanding it |

Plagiarism can be accidental or intentional, but the consequences are the same. Always keep careful notes on your sources and double-check your citations before submitting any work.

> ✅ Rule of thumb: If the idea, method, or phrasing is not yours—**cite it**.

When in doubt, cite. It’s better to have too many citations than too few.

**🔹 What is Self-Plagiarism?**

This surprises many students. If you wrote something before—can’t you reuse it?

Not always.

Self-plagiarism is often misunderstood. Even if you are the original author, reusing your own work without disclosure can mislead readers and reviewers. Always be transparent about what is new and what is reused.

You must disclose when:

- Reusing paragraphs from a prior class paper  
- Submitting the same work to two journals/conferences  
- Publishing multiple papers using the same dataset or results

> 📌 Journals and conferences expect **original work**, not recycled drafts.

If you want to build on your previous work, explain how the new paper extends or differs from the old one. Most venues allow this with proper disclosure.

---

**🔹 Double Submissions and Duplicate Publications**

Most venues follow a **strict rule**:  
> “Do not submit your paper to more than one venue at the same time.”

Submitting the same work to multiple venues is considered unethical because it wastes the time of editors and reviewers. It can also create confusion about who has the right to publish your work.

Why?

- It wastes reviewer time  
- It creates confusion over publication rights  
- It can get you banned from submitting in the future

Some exceptions exist (e.g., a workshop version → journal version), but **always disclose**.

If you’re unsure whether your submission counts as a duplicate, ask the editors or your advisor before proceeding.

**🔹 Publisher Policies: ACM and IEEE Examples**

| Publisher | Key Policy Highlights                                                                 |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ACM**   | Requires originality, prohibits duplicate submissions, investigates plagiarism        |
| **IEEE**  | Strict on self-plagiarism, uses plagiarism-detection software, may retract papers     |

Most major publishers have clear, public policies on academic integrity. Familiarize yourself with these before submitting your work. Violations can result in retraction, bans, or even legal action.

> ✅ Visit the publisher’s website and read their **Author Ethics** page before submitting.

Many publishers also provide resources and checklists to help you avoid common mistakes. Take advantage of these tools.

## Self-Check Questions

1. Are you citing ideas—even if you’re not quoting them directly?
2. Are you reusing any material from your previous work? If yes, are you disclosing it?
3. Have you read the submission policy of your target venue?

Reflect on your current practices and identify any areas where you could be more transparent or careful. Academic integrity is a habit, not a one-time action.

## Try This Exercise

> **Integrity Audit Prompt**  
> Choose one of your current or past writing drafts. Ask:

- Did I copy or closely paraphrase any source?
- Did I cite every paper I used—even if indirectly?
- Am I planning to submit this to multiple venues?
- Have I reused results, graphs, or methods from another project?

If you find any issues, address them before submitting your work. It’s always better to correct mistakes early than to deal with consequences later.

If yes to any of these, write a disclosure note and ask your advisor what’s acceptable in your case.

Open communication with your advisor or collaborators is key. They can help you navigate tricky situations and ensure your work meets the highest standards.

## Researcher’s Compass

You can build a strong academic reputation from your first paper onward—if you lead with transparency and respect.

Academic integrity is a lifelong commitment. The habits you build now will serve you throughout your career, whether you stay in academia or move into industry.

- Don’t underestimate how seriously journals and universities treat misconduct.
- Don’t fear citations—**they build your credibility**, not weaken it.
- And don’t hesitate to ask when you’re unsure.

> Integrity is not just about rules. It’s about honoring the work of others while building your own.

Lead by example, and you’ll earn the trust and respect of your peers, mentors, and the broader research community.
