# **Part II – Mapping the Research Landscape**

> *“You can’t contribute to a field you don’t understand. Before you build your thesis, learn the terrain of where ideas live, get published, and get cited.”*

---

## **🌐 Understanding the World You're Entering**

Once you've chosen your direction, you might feel tempted to dive straight into coding or writing.

It's natural to want to start building immediately. But effective research requires context—understanding what's been done, where the conversations are happening, and how knowledge flows through the academic community.

But research isn't just about building something new—it's about building on what's already been done. And to do that, you need to understand the **ecosystem of academic research**:  
Where is knowledge stored? How is it shared? What makes some papers more important or trusted than others?

The academic world has its own infrastructure, norms, and hierarchies. Learning to navigate this landscape will help you find the right sources, avoid wasting time on low-quality work, and position your own research effectively.

This part of the handbook will teach you to read the map before making your mark.

Think of this as learning the rules of the game. Once you understand how research is published, shared, and evaluated, you'll be able to participate with confidence and strategy.

## **What You'll Master in This Part**

- The differences between journals, conferences, workshops, and preprints
- Where and how to find papers that actually matter for your field
- The role of publishers and academic platforms like IEEE, ACM, DBLP, and Google Scholar
- How to evaluate the credibility and quality of a research venue (and how to start small)

You'll develop a researcher's eye for quality and relevance, learning to distinguish between influential work and noise.

## **Why This Part Matters**

Many students spend weeks reading random PDFs, unsure if the papers are relevant, credible, or even peer-reviewed.

Without a clear understanding of the research landscape, you risk building on shaky foundations or missing important work that could inform your approach.

This part will help you:

- Avoid "PDF hoarding" and focus your reading
- Understand the lifecycle of a research paper—from submission to citation
- Recognize which venues are respected in your domain (and which to avoid)
- Start building a reading strategy that supports your future writing

These skills will serve you throughout your research journey, helping you stay current, write stronger literature reviews, and choose the best venues for your own work.

> **Bottom line:** If your research journey is a hike, this part is your map and compass.  
> By the end of Part II, you won't just be consuming research—you'll know *how to navigate it*.

Invest time in understanding the landscape now, and you'll save yourself countless hours of confusion and frustration later.
