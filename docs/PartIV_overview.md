# **Part IV – Academic Integrity & Writing With Impact**

> *“Great research isn’t just about what you discover—it’s about how ethically and clearly you communicate it.”*

---

## **✍️ From Ideas to Trustworthy Writing**

Reading and collecting research is only half the battle.  
At some point, you’ll need to start writing—and when you do, questions will start to pile up:

- How much can I copy from the abstract if I cite it?  
- What even counts as plagiarism in research?  
- How do I cite 30+ papers without going insane?  
- How do I *actually* write a good Related Work section?

This part of the handbook tackles the often-overlooked side of research writing:  
**Academic integrity, citation practices, and clear, ethical communication.**

## **What You’ll Master in This Part**

- What counts as plagiarism (and how to avoid it in subtle cases like self-plagiarism and paraphrasing)
- The rules of proper citation (APA, IEEE, BibTeX, Zotero, etc.)
- How to write a well-organized Related Work section using your notes and literature matrix
- How to build credibility through writing style, clarity, and proper attribution

## **Why This Part Matters**

Even excellent technical work can get rejected—or worse, **retracted**—if it lacks academic integrity.

But beyond avoiding mistakes, this part helps you:

- Write more clearly and credibly
- Build trust with reviewers
- Position your research within the broader conversation
- Show that you’ve *done your homework*—and that your work builds meaningfully on what came before

> **Bottom line**: Your ideas deserve to be heard—but they also need to be *respected*.  
> This part will show you how to write in a way that’s both ethical and effective.
