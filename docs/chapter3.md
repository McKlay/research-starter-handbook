# Chapter 3: How to Settle on a Thesis Topic

> “*A good thesis topic isn’t just interesting. It’s feasible, relevant, and meaningful—to the field, and to you.*”

---

## Why This Chapter Matters

Many students believe choosing a thesis topic is about finding a “cool idea.”  
But in reality, the best topics are often born from **constraints**—your time, tools, interests, goals, and the world you’re trying to impact.

It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of new technologies or trending fields. But the reality is that every research project faces limits—deadlines, available data, institutional support, and your own energy. The most successful theses are those that work within these boundaries, turning constraints into creative opportunities. By understanding what’s possible, you can avoid frustration and set yourself up for a rewarding experience.

This chapter will help you move from a vague interest to a concrete, researchable topic. We’ll break down how to balance feasibility, relevance, and personal alignment—so you can choose a direction that’s both **doable** and **worth doing**.

## Conceptual Breakdown

**🔹 Feasibility: Time, Tools, Cost, and Scope**

Before you fall in love with an idea, check its constraints:

- **Time**: Can you realistically finish within 6–12 months?
- **Tools**: Do you have access to the datasets, frameworks, or equipment?
- **Cost**: Are there expensive licenses, APIs, or hardware requirements?
- **Scope**: Can the work be broken down into milestones with measurable progress?

Feasibility is the foundation of any good thesis. Even the most exciting idea can become overwhelming if it’s too ambitious. Break your project into phases—literature review, data collection, prototyping, analysis, writing—and estimate how long each will take. Talk to your advisor or peers about what’s realistic. Remember, a well-scoped project is more likely to succeed and less likely to burn you out.

> ✍️ Tip: If your idea *requires* a drone or quantum GPU and you don’t have one, it’s not feasible—*yet*.

**🔹 Relevance: Impact to Field, Society, or Country**

Your topic should matter—somehow. That doesn’t mean it has to be groundbreaking.  
But it should:

- Advance understanding in your field  
- Solve a real problem or inefficiency  
- Contribute to your community, institution, or country  
- Offer new insight, data, or tooling—even if small

Relevance gives your work purpose. Ask yourself: Who benefits from this research? Is there a community, organization, or group that would use your results? Sometimes, relevance means addressing a local issue or improving a process in your university. Other times, it’s about contributing to a global conversation. Even incremental improvements matter—don’t underestimate the value of small but meaningful contributions.

**Examples**:
- Improving access to legal aid using AI (social relevance)  
- Optimizing model accuracy for local dialects (regional contribution)  
- Analyzing outdated government systems (policy impact)

Try to connect your topic to current events, policy debates, or industry needs. Read recent papers and news articles to see what problems are being discussed. This will help you frame your work in a way that resonates with others and increases its impact.

**🔹 Personal Growth and Career Alignment**

Here’s the overlooked ingredient:  
**Will this thesis help you grow into the person you want to become?**

Ask:

- Will I learn a skill I want to master?
- Will this project open doors to the kind of work I want to do after graduation?
- Will I feel proud to talk about this one year from now?

Personal alignment is what keeps you motivated when the work gets tough. Think about your long-term goals—do you want to work in industry, pursue a PhD, start a company, or make a difference in your community? Choose a topic that helps you build the skills and network you’ll need. If possible, seek out mentors or collaborators who share your interests. The relationships you build during your thesis can shape your career for years to come.

This *alignment* will carry you through the long nights.

**🔹 From Idea to Topic Statement**

Here’s a simple structure to convert vague ideas into actionable research topics:

> *“I want to explore [field or method] to solve [problem or question] in [context or dataset], using [technique or framework], because [reason it matters].”*

**Example**:  
> *I want to explore NLP techniques to assist legal triage in the Philippines, using GPT-powered chatbots and government data, because legal aid is currently under-resourced and unevenly distributed.*

Start by brainstorming several versions of your topic statement. Share them with your advisor or peers and ask for feedback. Refine your statement until it’s clear, specific, and actionable. A strong topic statement will guide your research and help you stay focused when challenges arise.

## Self-Check Questions

1. What are the **top 3 topics** you’re considering? Why those?
2. For each one, rate 1–5:
   - Do I *care* about this?
   - Is this *feasible* with my resources?
   - Can this be *framed as a research problem* (not just a project)?
   - Will this help me *grow* professionally?
3. Which one scores highest across all?

Take time to write out your answers. Don’t rush this process—sometimes, the act of rating and reflecting reveals insights you hadn’t considered. If you’re stuck, talk through your options with a mentor or friend. The best topic is often the one that balances passion, practicality, and growth.

## Try This Exercise

> **Feasibility Matrix**  
> Create a table with the following headers:
> | Topic Idea | Required Resources | Potential Barriers | Personal Motivation | Research Gap |

Fill this for each topic you’re considering. The best choice may not be the most exciting—it may be the one that balances all factors.

As you fill out your matrix, be honest about what you have and what you’ll need. Are there skills you need to learn? Is there data you need to collect? Are there risks you can mitigate? This exercise helps you see your options clearly and make a decision based on evidence, not just excitement.

## Researcher’s Compass

You’re not trying to find *the* perfect topic.  
You’re trying to find *a* good-enough topic that you can finish, learn from, and contribute through.

It’s okay if:

- It’s been studied before (you’ll offer a new angle or dataset)
- It’s not flashy (it’s still real, working research)
- You refine it as you go (all real research evolves)

The journey of research is about growth, not perfection. Every project teaches you something—about your field, your process, and yourself. Stay flexible and open to change. If you need to adjust your topic along the way, that’s normal. What matters most is that you finish, learn, and make a contribution, however small.

Remember, your thesis is a stepping stone. Use it to build skills, relationships, and confidence for whatever comes next. Celebrate your progress and don’t be afraid to ask for help. You’re part of a community of researchers, all learning and growing together.

> What matters is this:  
> You are doing *meaningful work* that fits *your constraints* and moves *someone’s understanding*—even just a little—forward.
