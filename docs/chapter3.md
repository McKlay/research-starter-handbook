# Chapter 3: How to Settle on a Thesis Topic

> “*A good thesis topic isn’t just interesting. It’s feasible, relevant, and meaningful—to the field, and to you.*”

---

## Why This Chapter Matters

Many students believe choosing a thesis topic is about finding a “cool idea.”  
But in reality, the best topics are often born from **constraints**—your time, tools, interests, goals, and the world you’re trying to impact.

This chapter will help you move from a vague interest to a concrete, researchable topic. We’ll break down how to balance feasibility, relevance, and personal alignment—so you can choose a direction that’s both **doable** and **worth doing**.

---

## Conceptual Breakdown

**🔹 Feasibility: Time, Tools, Cost, and Scope**

Before you fall in love with an idea, check its constraints:

- **Time**: Can you realistically finish within 6–12 months?
- **Tools**: Do you have access to the datasets, frameworks, or equipment?
- **Cost**: Are there expensive licenses, APIs, or hardware requirements?
- **Scope**: Can the work be broken down into milestones with measurable progress?

> ✍️ Tip: If your idea *requires* a drone or quantum GPU and you don’t have one, it’s not feasible—*yet*.

---

**🔹 Relevance: Impact to Field, Society, or Country**

Your topic should matter—somehow. That doesn’t mean it has to be groundbreaking.  
But it should:

- Advance understanding in your field  
- Solve a real problem or inefficiency  
- Contribute to your community, institution, or country  
- Offer new insight, data, or tooling—even if small

**Examples**:
- Improving access to legal aid using AI (social relevance)  
- Optimizing model accuracy for local dialects (regional contribution)  
- Analyzing outdated government systems (policy impact)

---

**🔹 Personal Growth and Career Alignment**

Here’s the overlooked ingredient:  
**Will this thesis help you grow into the person you want to become?**

Ask:

- Will I learn a skill I want to master?
- Will this project open doors to the kind of work I want to do after graduation?
- Will I feel proud to talk about this one year from now?

This *alignment* will carry you through the long nights.

**🔹 From Idea to Topic Statement**

Here’s a simple structure to convert vague ideas into actionable research topics:

> *“I want to explore [field or method] to solve [problem or question] in [context or dataset], using [technique or framework], because [reason it matters].”*

**Example**:  
> *I want to explore NLP techniques to assist legal triage in the Philippines, using GPT-powered chatbots and government data, because legal aid is currently under-resourced and unevenly distributed.*

## Self-Check Questions

1. What are the **top 3 topics** you’re considering? Why those?
2. For each one, rate 1–5:
   - Do I *care* about this?
   - Is this *feasible* with my resources?
   - Can this be *framed as a research problem* (not just a project)?
   - Will this help me *grow* professionally?
3. Which one scores highest across all?

## Try This Exercise

> **Feasibility Matrix**  
> Create a table with the following headers:
> | Topic Idea | Required Resources | Potential Barriers | Personal Motivation | Research Gap |

Fill this for each topic you’re considering. The best choice may not be the most exciting—it may be the one that balances all factors.

---

## Researcher’s Compass

You’re not trying to find *the* perfect topic.  
You’re trying to find *a* good-enough topic that you can finish, learn from, and contribute through.

It’s okay if:

- It’s been studied before (you’ll offer a new angle or dataset)
- It’s not flashy (it’s still real, working research)
- You refine it as you go (all real research evolves)

> What matters is this:  
> You are doing *meaningful work* that fits *your constraints* and moves *someone’s understanding*—even just a little—forward.
