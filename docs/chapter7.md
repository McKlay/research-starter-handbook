# Chapter 7: Where to Find the Literature

> *“You can’t build on prior work if you never find the right work. Research starts with search.”*

---

## Why This Chapter Matters

One of the most common questions new researchers ask is:  
**“Where do I even find the papers I’m supposed to read?”**

The ability to find and evaluate literature is a core research skill. It’s not just about collecting PDFs—it’s about building a foundation for your own work. The right sources will help you understand the state of the art, avoid reinventing the wheel, and identify gaps you can address. With so many platforms and tools available, knowing how to search efficiently is as important as knowing what to search for.

Sure, your advisor might throw a few PDFs your way. But building a strong thesis—or publishing your own work—requires a wider net.  
You need to know where to look, what to trust, and how to dig deeper.

This chapter will give you a toolbox of **platforms**, **search engines**, and **research discovery tools** so you can find credible, relevant, and up-to-date work—without getting lost in a swamp of random PDFs.

## Conceptual Breakdown

**🔹 Academic Search Engines vs. Libraries**

Let’s distinguish two types of tools:

Academic search engines are designed for discovery. They help you cast a wide net, find connections between papers, and follow citation trails. Digital libraries, on the other hand, are curated collections managed by professional organizations. They provide authoritative versions of papers, often with supplementary materials and official citation formats.

| Type                   | Examples                              | Purpose                                  |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Search Engines**     | Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar      | Broad discovery, citation chaining       |
| **Digital Libraries**  | ACM DL, IEEE Xplore, SpringerLink     | Authoritative source, full-text access   |

Search engines cast a wide net. Libraries give you official, citable copies.

Whenever possible, download papers from official libraries to ensure you’re reading the final, peer-reviewed version.

**🔹 Platforms You Should Know**

| Platform            | Use Case                                                                 |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Google Scholar**  | Fastest way to find papers + citation counts + related works             |
| **Semantic Scholar**| AI-powered highlights, TLDRs, and citation context                       |
| **DBLP**            | Great for structured CS publication lists and author profiles            |
| **IEEE Xplore**     | Best for CS/EE fields (AI, vision, robotics, signal processing)          |
| **ACM Digital Library** | Excellent for HCI, software engineering, systems research         |
| **arXiv**           | Open preprints (especially for ML/AI/NLP/vision), often before peer review|

Each platform has its strengths. Google Scholar is great for quick searches and citation tracking, while Semantic Scholar helps you scan papers for relevance. DBLP is invaluable for verifying publication records and exploring author networks. IEEE Xplore and ACM DL are the gold standard for authoritative CS papers. arXiv is the go-to for cutting-edge, pre-publication work.

> 🔎 Pro Tip: Always check if your school gives **institutional access**—this unlocks many paywalled papers via your university library.

If you don’t have institutional access, look for open-access versions or contact authors directly. Many researchers are happy to share their work.

**🔹 Specialized Discovery Tools**

Here are tools that make literature exploration smarter, not harder:

These tools go beyond simple search—they help you visualize connections, track new publications, and organize your reading. They’re especially useful for building a literature review or exploring unfamiliar topics.

- **Connected Papers**: Build a visual graph of related work from a single seed paper  
  → [https://connectedpapers.com](https://connectedpapers.com)

- **Litmaps**: Track related papers as they’re published, auto-organize by topic  
  → [https://www.litmaps.com](https://www.litmaps.com)

- **ResearchRabbit**: Create “rabbit holes” of paper relationships across time and topics  
  → [https://www.researchrabbit.ai](https://www.researchrabbit.ai)

> These are gold for building your literature review, seeing evolution of ideas, and finding missing gaps.

Try using these tools early in your research process to map out the landscape and identify influential papers.

**🔹 Which Platform Should I Use When?**

| Goal                                      | Best Tools                                 |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Get quick overview of a topic              | Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar            |
| Find the original source of a paper        | DBLP, IEEE Xplore, ACM DL                   |
| Explore related works visually             | Connected Papers, Litmaps, ResearchRabbit   |
| Access cutting-edge work (pre-peer-review)| arXiv, Twitter threads from researchers     |
| Track an author or lab                     | DBLP, Google Scholar profiles               |

As your research progresses, you’ll likely use several platforms for different purposes. Don’t be afraid to experiment and find the combination that works best for you.

## Self-Check Questions

1. What platform do you *default* to when looking for papers? Why?
2. Have you tried using any visual literature mapping tools?
3. Do you know which platforms are most relevant to *your field* (e.g., NLP vs HCI)?

Reflect on your answers and ask your advisor or peers for recommendations. The right tools can make your literature search much more efficient and enjoyable.

## Try This Exercise

> **Build a Paper Discovery Toolkit**  
> Choose one topic you’re interested in (e.g., “object detection for drones” or “LLMs for legal document analysis”).

Search that topic using the following tools and record what you find:

- Google Scholar  
- Semantic Scholar  
- Connected Papers  
- IEEE Xplore or ACM DL  
- DBLP  

For each, ask:

- Which gave the most useful papers?  
- Which showed citation counts?  
- Which offered recent vs. older papers?

As you complete this exercise, pay attention to the differences in search results and user experience. Over time, you’ll develop a sense for which platforms are best for different stages of your research.

You’ll start to see patterns—and preferences.

## Researcher’s Compass

Good research is built on good sources.  
And good sources are only useful if you can actually *find* them.

Building a reliable search strategy is an investment in your future work. The more comfortable you become with these tools, the easier it will be to stay current, write strong literature reviews, and identify new research opportunities.

Don’t rely on a single platform.  
Instead, build your own **search stack**—a reliable set of tools that helps you:

- Discover new ideas  
- Trace citation trails  
- Collect trustworthy, peer-reviewed work

> Research isn’t about knowing everything. It’s about knowing *where to look*—and *how to follow the thread*.

Stay curious, keep exploring new platforms, and don’t hesitate to ask for help when you hit a wall. The best researchers are those who know how to find, evaluate, and build on the work of others.
