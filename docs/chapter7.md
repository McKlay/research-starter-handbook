# Chapter 7: Where to Find the Literature

> *“You can’t build on prior work if you never find the right work. Research starts with search.”*

---

## Why This Chapter Matters

One of the most common questions new researchers ask is:  
**“Where do I even find the papers I’m supposed to read?”**

Sure, your advisor might throw a few PDFs your way. But building a strong thesis—or publishing your own work—requires a wider net.  
You need to know where to look, what to trust, and how to dig deeper.

This chapter will give you a toolbox of **platforms**, **search engines**, and **research discovery tools** so you can find credible, relevant, and up-to-date work—without getting lost in a swamp of random PDFs.

## Conceptual Breakdown

**🔹 Academic Search Engines vs. Libraries**

Let’s distinguish two types of tools:

| Type                   | Examples                              | Purpose                                  |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Search Engines**     | Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar      | Broad discovery, citation chaining       |
| **Digital Libraries**  | ACM DL, IEEE Xplore, SpringerLink     | Authoritative source, full-text access   |

Search engines cast a wide net. Libraries give you official, citable copies.

**🔹 Platforms You Should Know**

| Platform            | Use Case                                                                 |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Google Scholar**  | Fastest way to find papers + citation counts + related works             |
| **Semantic Scholar**| AI-powered highlights, TLDRs, and citation context                       |
| **DBLP**            | Great for structured CS publication lists and author profiles            |
| **IEEE Xplore**     | Best for CS/EE fields (AI, vision, robotics, signal processing)          |
| **ACM Digital Library** | Excellent for HCI, software engineering, systems research         |
| **arXiv**           | Open preprints (especially for ML/AI/NLP/vision), often before peer review|

> 🔎 Pro Tip: Always check if your school gives **institutional access**—this unlocks many paywalled papers via your university library.

**🔹 Specialized Discovery Tools**

Here are tools that make literature exploration smarter, not harder:

- **Connected Papers**: Build a visual graph of related work from a single seed paper  
  → [https://connectedpapers.com](https://connectedpapers.com)

- **Litmaps**: Track related papers as they’re published, auto-organize by topic  
  → [https://www.litmaps.com](https://www.litmaps.com)

- **ResearchRabbit**: Create “rabbit holes” of paper relationships across time and topics  
  → [https://www.researchrabbit.ai](https://www.researchrabbit.ai)

> These are gold for building your literature review, seeing evolution of ideas, and finding missing gaps.

**🔹 Which Platform Should I Use When?**

| Goal                                      | Best Tools                                 |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Get quick overview of a topic              | Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar            |
| Find the original source of a paper        | DBLP, IEEE Xplore, ACM DL                   |
| Explore related works visually             | Connected Papers, Litmaps, ResearchRabbit   |
| Access cutting-edge work (pre-peer-review)| arXiv, Twitter threads from researchers     |
| Track an author or lab                     | DBLP, Google Scholar profiles               |

## Self-Check Questions

1. What platform do you *default* to when looking for papers? Why?
2. Have you tried using any visual literature mapping tools?
3. Do you know which platforms are most relevant to *your field* (e.g., NLP vs HCI)?

---

## Try This Exercise

> **Build a Paper Discovery Toolkit**  
> Choose one topic you’re interested in (e.g., “object detection for drones” or “LLMs for legal document analysis”).

Search that topic using the following tools and record what you find:

- Google Scholar  
- Semantic Scholar  
- Connected Papers  
- IEEE Xplore or ACM DL  
- DBLP  

For each, ask:

- Which gave the most useful papers?  
- Which showed citation counts?  
- Which offered recent vs. older papers?

You’ll start to see patterns—and preferences.

## Researcher’s Compass

Good research is built on good sources.  
And good sources are only useful if you can actually *find* them.

Don’t rely on a single platform.  
Instead, build your own **search stack**—a reliable set of tools that helps you:

- Discover new ideas  
- Trace citation trails  
- Collect trustworthy, peer-reviewed work

> Research isn’t about knowing everything. It’s about knowing *where to look*—and *how to follow the thread*.
