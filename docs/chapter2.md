# Chapter 2: Types of CS Research Topics

> “*Not all research is built the same. Some prove theorems, some build systems, some ask questions no one thought to ask.*”

---

## Why This Chapter Matters

Computer Science is not a single discipline—it’s a constellation of subfields, each with its own values, methods, and outputs.

Some researchers build software or hardware systems. Others write mathematical proofs. Some conduct user studies; others train deep learning models. All of them are doing “research,” but what they *do* day-to-day is vastly different.

This chapter will help you map the landscape of CS research categories so you can ask:  
**What kind of builder do I want to be?**

Understanding these research types early will save you from wasted time chasing projects that don’t fit your interests, skills, or goals.

## Conceptual Breakdown

**🔹 Systems vs. Theory vs. Empirical Research**

At a high level, CS research can be grouped into three big families:

| Type       | What It Focuses On                             | Common Output                         |
|------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Systems**| Building working software/hardware             | Frameworks, tools, protocols, datasets |
| **Theory** | Proving things mathematically                  | Lemmas, theorems, complexity classes   |
| **Empirical**| Testing and observing real-world behavior    | Experiments, user studies, evaluations |

Each has a different *culture* of proof, writing, and publication.

**🔹 Applied vs. Fundamental vs. Exploratory**

This is another lens to examine your direction:

| Type           | Key Question                                | Example Topic                          |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Applied**    | “How can we use this to solve X?”           | Using AI to predict floods             |
| **Fundamental**| “What are the limits or properties of Y?”   | Proving limits of cryptographic hash   |
| **Exploratory**| “What happens if we try Z?”                 | Visualizing large language model errors|

You can mix and match. Some applied work has theoretical backing. Some exploratory work becomes the seed of a new applied method.

**🔹 Quantitative vs. Qualitative Methods**

CS isn't only about numbers.

- **Quantitative** research includes benchmarks, metrics, statistical tests, ML model performance, etc.

- **Qualitative** research includes interviews, thematic analysis, user feedback, open coding, etc.

HCI (Human-Computer Interaction), ICT4D (Tech for Development), and EdTech often use both.

> Don’t assume “real research” only means code and math. If your research deals with people, policy, or perception—qualitative work is not just valid, it’s *critical*.

---

**🔹 Social Good and Interdisciplinary Research**

Some of the most impactful CS work lies at the intersection of disciplines:

- AI + Law → Legal tech, case triage, transparency bots  
- CS + Agriculture → Smart irrigation, drone surveillance, soil health analysis  
- CS + Education → Intelligent tutors, learning analytics  
- CS + Government → Budget bots, policy dashboards, fraud detection  

These projects often:

- Use **applied methods**  
- Require collaboration with domain experts  
- Involve both technical and human/systemic thinking  

This is where *you* come in. Your domain interests (education, justice, media, health, etc.) can drive the tech you build.

## Self-Check Questions

1. Do you enjoy **building and debugging systems**? (You may lean toward Systems research.)

2. Do you love **math, proofs, and abstract thinking**? (You might be drawn to Theory.)

3. Do you prefer **testing, analyzing, and validating behaviors or ideas**? (Empirical work may suit you.)

4. Do you care about **solving real-world problems** or building **tools for people**? (Consider applied and interdisciplinary research.)

5. Do you see your research as a way to **serve a community or cause**? (Look into social good and policy-related research.)

## Try This Exercise

> **Mapping Your Curiosity**:  
> Make a 3-column table:
> - Column A: Fields you’re curious about (e.g., AI, CV, Networks, HCI, NLP)
> - Column B: Related real-world problems (e.g., access to justice, misinformation, disaster response)
> - Column C: Sample research types (system design, theoretical analysis, ML benchmarking, etc.)

You don’t need to pick one yet—just start seeing patterns.

## Researcher’s Compass

Choosing a topic is only half the question. The other half is:  
**What kind of *work* are you excited to do every day?**

Some researchers build. Others analyze. Some test. Some prove.  
You don’t need to do it all.

Find your mode of inquiry—the method that makes you feel *curious*, *engaged*, and *capable*—and you’ll be more likely to finish what you start.
