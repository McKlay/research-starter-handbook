# Chapter 2: Types of CS Research Topics

> “*Not all research is built the same. Some prove theorems, some build systems, some ask questions no one thought to ask.*”

---

## Why This Chapter Matters

Computer Science is not a single discipline—it’s a constellation of subfields, each with its own values, methods, and outputs.

As you begin to explore research, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed by the sheer variety of topics and approaches. Some students gravitate toward coding and building, while others are drawn to abstract puzzles or real-world impact. Understanding the landscape early helps you make informed choices and avoid frustration. The more you know about the different types of research, the better you can align your work with your strengths and passions.

Some researchers build software or hardware systems. Others write mathematical proofs. Some conduct user studies; others train deep learning models. All of them are doing “research,” but what they *do* day-to-day is vastly different.

This chapter will help you map the landscape of CS research categories so you can ask:  
**What kind of builder do I want to be?**

Understanding these research types early will save you from wasted time chasing projects that don’t fit your interests, skills, or goals.

## Conceptual Breakdown

**🔹 Systems vs. Theory vs. Empirical Research**

At a high level, CS research can be grouped into three big families:

Let’s look closer at what these families mean in practice:

- **Systems** research is hands-on and creative. You might design a new database, build a robotics platform, or develop a novel networking protocol. The work is often collaborative, involving teams and iterative testing. Success is measured by whether your system works, scales, and solves real problems.

- **Theory** research is about deep thinking and abstraction. You’ll spend time with mathematical proofs, logic, and complexity. The work is solitary at times, but also involves lively debates and peer review. Success is measured by the elegance and rigor of your results, and their impact on how we understand computation.

- **Empirical** research is investigative. You’ll design experiments, collect data, and analyze results. This could mean running user studies, benchmarking algorithms, or evaluating new technologies in the field. Success is measured by the quality of your evidence and the insights you uncover about real-world behavior.

| Type       | What It Focuses On                             | Common Output                         |
|------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Systems**| Building working software/hardware             | Frameworks, tools, protocols, datasets |
| **Theory** | Proving things mathematically                  | Lemmas, theorems, complexity classes   |
| **Empirical**| Testing and observing real-world behavior    | Experiments, user studies, evaluations |

Each has a different *culture* of proof, writing, and publication.

For example, a systems paper might include code and performance benchmarks, while a theory paper focuses on definitions and proofs. Empirical work often features charts, statistics, and discussion of limitations. Learning to recognize these cultures will help you read papers more effectively and communicate your own work.

**🔹 Applied vs. Fundamental vs. Exploratory**

This is another lens to examine your direction:

These categories are not rigid boxes. Many projects blend applied, fundamental, and exploratory elements. For instance, you might start with an exploratory idea, develop a fundamental understanding, and then apply it to solve a real problem. The key is to notice which questions excite you most—do you want to build, understand, or discover?

| Type           | Key Question                                | Example Topic                          |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Applied**    | “How can we use this to solve X?”           | Using AI to predict floods             |
| **Fundamental**| “What are the limits or properties of Y?”   | Proving limits of cryptographic hash   |
| **Exploratory**| “What happens if we try Z?”                 | Visualizing large language model errors|

You can mix and match. Some applied work has theoretical backing. Some exploratory work becomes the seed of a new applied method.

**🔹 Quantitative vs. Qualitative Methods**

CS isn't only about numbers.

- **Quantitative** research includes benchmarks, metrics, statistical tests, ML model performance, etc.

- **Qualitative** research includes interviews, thematic analysis, user feedback, open coding, etc.

HCI (Human-Computer Interaction), ICT4D (Tech for Development), and EdTech often use both.

Choosing your method depends on your research question. If you want to measure how fast an algorithm runs, you’ll use quantitative methods. If you want to understand how people feel about a new technology, qualitative methods are essential. Many impactful projects combine both, using numbers to show what’s happening and stories to explain why.

> Don’t assume “real research” only means code and math. If your research deals with people, policy, or perception—qualitative work is not just valid, it’s *critical*.

**🔹 Social Good and Interdisciplinary Research**

Some of the most impactful CS work lies at the intersection of disciplines:

- AI + Law → Legal tech, case triage, transparency bots  
- CS + Agriculture → Smart irrigation, drone surveillance, soil health analysis  
- CS + Education → Intelligent tutors, learning analytics  
- CS + Government → Budget bots, policy dashboards, fraud detection  

These projects often:

- Use **applied methods**  
- Require collaboration with domain experts  
- Involve both technical and human/systemic thinking  

Interdisciplinary research is challenging but rewarding. You’ll need to learn the language of other fields, build relationships, and adapt your methods. The payoff is the chance to make a real difference in society. If you’re passionate about a cause—education, justice, health—consider how CS can amplify your impact.

This is where *you* come in. Your domain interests (education, justice, media, health, etc.) can drive the tech you build.

## Self-Check Questions

1. Do you enjoy **building and debugging systems**? (You may lean toward Systems research.)

2. Do you love **math, proofs, and abstract thinking**? (You might be drawn to Theory.)

3. Do you prefer **testing, analyzing, and validating behaviors or ideas**? (Empirical work may suit you.)

4. Do you care about **solving real-world problems** or building **tools for people**? (Consider applied and interdisciplinary research.)

5. Do you see your research as a way to **serve a community or cause**? (Look into social good and policy-related research.)

Reflect on your answers and consider discussing them with a mentor or peer. Sometimes, talking through your interests helps clarify your direction. Remember, your preferences may change as you gain experience—stay open to new possibilities.

## Try This Exercise

> **Mapping Your Curiosity**:  
> Make a 3-column table:
> - Column A: Fields you’re curious about (e.g., AI, CV, Networks, HCI, NLP)
> - Column B: Related real-world problems (e.g., access to justice, misinformation, disaster response)
> - Column C: Sample research types (system design, theoretical analysis, ML benchmarking, etc.)

You don’t need to pick one yet—just start seeing patterns.

As you fill out your table, look for connections between fields and problems. Are there areas where your interests overlap? Do certain research types appeal to you more than others? This exercise is meant to spark ideas and help you visualize your options.

## Researcher’s Compass

Choosing a topic is only half the question. The other half is:  
**What kind of *work* are you excited to do every day?**

Some researchers build. Others analyze. Some test. Some prove.  
You don’t need to do it all.

The best research is the kind that keeps you engaged and motivated. Pay attention to what energizes you—whether it’s coding, writing, experimenting, or collaborating. Your compass is your curiosity. Let it guide you toward projects that feel meaningful and sustainable.

Remember, the journey of research is as important as the destination. Stay curious, keep exploring, and don’t be afraid to change course as you learn more about yourself and the field.

Find your mode of inquiry—the method that makes you feel *curious*, *engaged*, and *capable*—and you’ll be more likely to finish what you start.
