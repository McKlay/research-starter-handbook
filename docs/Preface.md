### Why This Book Exists

This handbook was born not from authority, but from necessity.

It’s a product of real confusion, trial and error, and the gradual discovery that research is as much about process as it is about results. I wrote this for the student who feels overwhelmed by the academic maze, for the builder who wants to make an impact but doesn’t know where to start, and for anyone who wishes someone had just explained the basics, step by step.

As a new researcher in a Master’s program, I expected guidance on how to *“do research.”* Instead, I found myself **lost in a maze of unfamiliar terms**—journals, conferences, venues, citations, impact factors—without a map, compass, or even a starting point. No one taught us how to find actual research papers. Or how to tell if something was peer-reviewed. Or how to explore what others have already built in our chosen topic.

The academic world can feel like it’s full of hidden rules and unspoken expectations. I remember the frustration of searching for a single credible paper, the anxiety of not knowing if my sources were legitimate, and the embarrassment of asking “basic” questions that everyone else seemed to already know. If you’ve felt this way, you’re not alone.

I didn’t know what I didn’t know.  
And that’s the most dangerous kind of blind spot.

This book is my attempt to shine a light on those blind spots, to make the invisible visible, and to give you the confidence to ask better questions and find better answers.

At the same time, I was wrestling with a bigger question:  
> *“What topic should I pursue for my thesis?”*

That question haunted me for months. I cycled through ideas, doubted my choices, and worried about picking the “wrong” path. But every misstep taught me something valuable about the research process—and about myself.

I started where I felt most inspired—**drones and computer vision.** I imagined autonomous systems, smart agriculture, and embedded AI. I built vision projects. I learned CNNs. But then reality hit: it was expensive, hardware-dependent, and logistically hard to execute without institutional resources. So I humbled myself—and pivoted.

The journey from inspiration to execution is rarely a straight line. It’s full of pivots, setbacks, and unexpected discoveries. What matters is not how quickly you find your topic, but how honestly you engage with the process.

I turned to **Natural Language Processing**, where everything could be built and tested in software alone. What began as a practical decision became a purpose-driven mission. I created intelligent chatbots. I built multi-modal apps like **ScanlyAI**. And then, I had my breakthrough moment:

Sometimes, the best direction is the one that emerges from constraints. When resources are limited, creativity flourishes. My shift to NLP wasn’t just about convenience—it was about finding a way to make a real difference with the tools I had.

> **AI can serve society—not just impress it.**

This insight crystallized into two thesis directions:

- **AI-Powered Legal Aid Chatbot** – Bringing access to justice closer to everyday Filipinos.
- **AI-Powered Transparency Assistant** – Letting citizens query government budgets and audit reports conversationally.

These weren’t just feasible. They were *impactful*.  
They didn’t just align with my skills. They aligned with my *values*.

Impact is what transforms research from an academic exercise into a meaningful pursuit. When your work aligns with your values, motivation follows naturally—even when the work gets hard.

So this book is more than a set of academic tips. It’s both:
- A **map for navigating the research ecosystem** (when no one teaches you how).
- And a **record of what it means to evolve—from vague interest to focused impact.**

You’ll find practical advice, hard-won lessons, and encouragement to keep going when things get messy. My hope is that this book will be the companion I wish I’d had—a guide, a reference, and a source of reassurance.

If you’ve ever felt lost choosing a topic, confused by academic structures, or frustrated with the lack of guidance, this handbook is for you.

You don’t have to have it all figured out. You just have to start.

### Who Should Read This

This handbook is for:

It’s written for anyone who wants to do research with purpose, clarity, and confidence—regardless of background or prior experience.

* **Graduate students**—especially those in technical or interdisciplinary programs who feel like they were thrown into the deep end without learning how to swim.
* **Early-stage researchers** trying to explore literature, validate their problem space, and understand what has already been done.
* **Self-taught builders** transitioning into the academic world of conferences, journals, and research ethics.
* **Professionals writing a thesis** after years of software development, seeking clarity without getting buried in jargon.

You don’t need a PhD mindset to use this guide.  
But you *do* need a beginner’s curiosity and a builder’s determination.

Bring your questions, your doubts, and your ambition. This book is designed to meet you where you are and help you move forward, one step at a time.

### From Chaos to Clarity: How This Book Was Born

The turning point came when I realized:  
> “I cannot finalize my methodology without first understanding what’s already been tried.”

That realization changed everything. It shifted my focus from rushing to results to building a foundation of knowledge and context. It taught me that research is a conversation—and that to contribute, you first have to listen.

That single insight reframed everything.

Before I could build my thesis, I had to build *context*.  
Before I could design experiments, I had to understand the *landscape*.  
Before I could claim novelty, I had to understand *what existed*.

And yet, no one showed us how to do that.

So I started asking the questions the classroom skipped:

- Where do I even find papers on my topic?
- What’s the difference between a journal and a conference paper?
- How do I know which sources are credible?
- What tools do real researchers use to track 100+ papers?
- How do I organize my reading so I don’t get overwhelmed?

Each time I found an answer, I wrote it down. What started as a survival strategy became a growing knowledge base. That base became a table of contents. And now, it’s this book.

This handbook is the product of hundreds of small discoveries, mistakes, and moments of clarity. It’s proof that you can go from confusion to capability, and that every question you ask brings you closer to understanding.

### What You’ll Learn (and What You Won’t)

You will learn:

The focus is on actionable steps, not abstract theory. You’ll find checklists, templates, and real-world examples to help you apply what you learn immediately.

* How to choose a research topic that fits your skills, values, and constraints.
* How to identify credible academic papers in your field.
* Where to find research papers, datasets, and tools.
* How to read, organize, and track what you've studied.
* What publishers, journals, and conferences are most relevant to CS.
* How to cite, paraphrase, and build your related work ethically.
* What tools (Zotero, BibTeX, Obsidian, etc.) can drastically improve your workflow.
* How the academic publishing and peer review process works—from CFP to revision.

You will *not* find:

* Generic theory about “what is research” with no practical use.
* Overly abstract philosophical debates with no application.
* Fluffy motivational filler about “believing in yourself.”
* Academic jargon with no clarity.

This is a **hands-on, confused-to-capable, read-this-before-your-thesis-falls-apart** type of book.

If you’re looking for a practical, no-nonsense guide to surviving and thriving in research, you’re in the right place.

### How to Read This Handbook

Each section is **modular** and **practical**.

You can use this book as a reference, a workbook, or a troubleshooting guide. Return to it whenever you hit a roadblock or need a dose of clarity.

- **You don’t have to read it in order.** Jump to the part that solves your current struggle.
- **Action steps** and **tools** are called out clearly—so you can apply them right away.
- **Appendices** include templates, citation guides, and sample materials to copy or adapt.
- Your topic may change. Your workflow may evolve. *That’s the point.* This handbook evolves with you.

This is not the book your professor handed out.  
This is the book *I wish someone handed me* when I first Googled:  
> “how to find related papers and write a research proposal in CS.”

Welcome to your research journey. Let’s build it, together.
