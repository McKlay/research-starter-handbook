### Why This Book Exists

This handbook was born not from authority—but from necessity.

As a new researcher in a Master’s program, I expected guidance on how to *“do research.”* Instead, I found myself **lost in a maze of unfamiliar terms**—journals, conferences, venues, citations, impact factors—without a map, compass, or even a starting point. No one taught us how to find actual research papers. Or how to tell if something was peer-reviewed. Or how to explore what others have already built in our chosen topic.

I didn’t know what I didn’t know.  
And that’s the most dangerous kind of blind spot.

At the same time, I was wrestling with a bigger question:  
> *“What topic should I pursue for my thesis?”*

I started where I felt most inspired—**drones and computer vision.** I imagined autonomous systems, smart agriculture, and embedded AI. I built vision projects. I learned CNNs. But then reality hit: it was expensive, hardware-dependent, and logistically hard to execute without institutional resources. So I humbled myself—and pivoted.

I turned to **Natural Language Processing**, where everything could be built and tested in software alone. What began as a practical decision became a purpose-driven mission. I created intelligent chatbots. I built multi-modal apps like **ScanlyAI**. And then, I had my breakthrough moment:

> **AI can serve society—not just impress it.**

This insight crystallized into two thesis directions:

- **AI-Powered Legal Aid Chatbot** – Bringing access to justice closer to everyday Filipinos.
- **AI-Powered Transparency Assistant** – Letting citizens query government budgets and audit reports conversationally.

These weren’t just feasible. They were *impactful*.  
They didn’t just align with my skills. They aligned with my *values*.

So this book is more than a set of academic tips. It’s both:
- A **map for navigating the research ecosystem** (when no one teaches you how).
- And a **record of what it means to evolve—from vague interest to focused impact.**

If you’ve ever felt lost choosing a topic, confused by academic structures, or frustrated with the lack of guidance—this handbook is for you.

### Who Should Read This

This handbook is for:

* 🎓 **Graduate students**—especially those in technical or interdisciplinary programs—who feel like they were thrown into the deep end without learning how to swim.
* 🔍 **Early-stage researchers** trying to explore literature, validate their problem space, and understand what has already been done.
* 🧠 **Self-taught builders** transitioning into the academic world of conferences, journals, and research ethics.
* 💼 **Professionals writing a thesis** after years of software development, seeking clarity without getting buried in jargon.

You don’t need a PhD mindset to use this guide.  
But you *do* need a beginner’s curiosity and a builder’s determination.

### From Chaos to Clarity: How This Book Was Born

The turning point came when I realized:  
> “I cannot finalize my methodology without first understanding what’s already been tried.”

That single insight reframed everything.

Before I could build my thesis, I had to build *context*.  
Before I could design experiments, I had to understand the *landscape*.  
Before I could claim novelty, I had to understand *what existed*.

And yet—no one showed us how to do that.

So I started asking the questions the classroom skipped:

- Where do I even find papers on my topic?
- What’s the difference between a journal and a conference paper?
- How do I know which sources are credible?
- What tools do real researchers use to track 100+ papers?
- How do I organize my reading so I don’t get overwhelmed?

Each time I found an answer, I wrote it down. What started as a survival strategy became a growing knowledge base. That base became a table of contents. And now, it’s this book.

### What You’ll Learn (and What You Won’t)

✅ You will learn:

* How to choose a research topic that fits your skills, values, and constraints.
* How to identify credible academic papers in your field.
* Where to find research papers, datasets, and tools.
* How to read, organize, and track what you've studied.
* What publishers, journals, and conferences are most relevant to CS.
* How to cite, paraphrase, and build your related work ethically.
* What tools (Zotero, BibTeX, Obsidian, etc.) can drastically improve your workflow.
* How the academic publishing and peer review process works—from CFP to revision.

❌ You will *not* find:

* Generic theory about “what is research” with no practical use.
* Overly abstract philosophical debates with no application.
* Fluffy motivational filler about “believing in yourself.”
* Academic jargon with no clarity.

This is a **hands-on, confused-to-capable, read-this-before-your-thesis-falls-apart** type of book.

### How to Read This Handbook

Each section is **modular** and **practical**.

- **You don’t have to read it in order.** Jump to the part that solves your current struggle.
- **Action steps** and **tools** are called out clearly—so you can apply them right away.
- **Appendices** include templates, citation guides, and sample materials to copy or adapt.
- Your topic may change. Your workflow may evolve. *That’s the point.* This handbook evolves with you.

This is not the book your professor handed out.  
This is the book *I wish someone handed me* when I first Googled:  
> “how to find related papers and write a research proposal in CS.”

Let’s build it, together.
