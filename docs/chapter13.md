# Chapter 13: Writing Your First Research Paper

> *“A great paper doesn’t just report results—it tells a clear, credible story of discovery.”*

---

## Why This Chapter Matters

Writing your first research paper is intimidating.  
There’s the structure, the formatting, the references, the figures—and the invisible voice in your head whispering: *“Am I doing this right?”*

The process can feel overwhelming, but every published researcher started exactly where you are now. The key is to break the task into manageable steps and to remember that writing is a skill you build with practice. Each draft brings you closer to clarity and confidence.

This chapter is here to quiet that voice.

By following proven structures and strategies, you’ll learn to communicate your ideas effectively and make your research stand out.

We’ll walk you through the anatomy of a research paper, explain what goes where (and why), and show you how to go from raw notes and experiments to a polished, submission-ready manuscript.

You’ll also pick up habits that will serve you well in future writing projects, from theses to journal articles.

## Conceptual Breakdown

**🔹 The IMRaD Structure: Your Default Template**

Most computer science research papers follow this core format:

IMRaD stands for Introduction, Methodology, Results, and Discussion/Conclusion. This structure helps readers quickly find the information they need and ensures your argument flows logically from problem to solution.

| Section       | Purpose                                                          |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Introduction** | State the problem, why it matters, and your core contribution |
| **Methodology**  | Explain what you did, how, and why you did it that way        |
| **Results**      | Present your findings with tables, charts, and comparisons    |
| **Discussion/Conclusion** | Reflect on what your results mean, limitations, future work |

Some papers also include a **Related Work** section (usually near the intro) and an **Abstract** at the very beginning.

Check your target venue’s guidelines for required sections and order. Some venues may combine or rename sections, so always adapt as needed.

> 📌 Tip: Read 2–3 papers from your target venue and mimic their structure closely.

Pay attention to how successful papers use figures, tables, and references to support their arguments.

**🔹 What Goes Into Each Section?**

### **Abstract**
- A summary of your entire paper in ~150–250 words  
- Should answer: What problem? What method? What result? Why it matters?

Write the abstract last, but keep notes as you go. A strong abstract is concise, specific, and highlights your main contribution.

### **Introduction**
- Hook the reader: Why is this problem important?  
- Define the gap in prior work  
- State your objective and main contribution clearly

Use the introduction to set the stage for your research. Make it clear why your work matters and what makes it different from previous efforts.

### **Related Work**
- Summarize key prior studies and how your work builds upon or differs from them  
- Use citations strategically to position your work

Organize this section thematically or by method, and always explain how your work fits into or advances the field.

### **Methodology**
- Describe your approach, system design, dataset, experimental setup  
- Be clear enough that someone could reproduce your work

Include enough detail for others to replicate your results. Use diagrams or pseudocode if it helps clarify your process.

### **Results**
- Show your findings with tables, graphs, metrics  
- Compare against baselines or prior work when possible

Highlight the most important findings and explain what they mean. Use visuals to make your results easy to interpret.

### **Conclusion**
- Restate what you achieved  
- Mention limitations and suggest future work  
- End with a strong takeaway message

The conclusion should leave readers with a clear sense of your contribution and its significance. Suggest next steps or open questions for future research.

**🔹 Common Formatting Styles: ACM and IEEE**

Most CS venues will ask you to submit in a specific format.

Formatting is not just about aesthetics—it ensures your paper meets professional standards and is easy for reviewers to read. Using the official template from the start saves time and reduces errors.

| Format | Where It's Used | Tools Available               |
|--------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| **IEEE**  | Engineering and many AI conferences | LaTeX template, Word template on IEEE author center |
| **ACM**   | SIG conferences (CHI, SIGIR, SIGCOMM, etc.) | ACM Primary Article Template (Word + LaTeX)          |

> ✅ Always start with the **official template** of your target venue. Never try to format from scratch.

If you’re new to LaTeX or Word templates, look for online tutorials or ask peers for help. Many venues provide sample papers to guide you.

**🔹 Helpful Writing Tips for Beginners**

- Use **active voice** where possible  
  > e.g., “We trained a CNN model…” instead of “A CNN model was trained…”

- Keep sentences short and precise  
- Use **section headers** to break up the narrative  
- Start writing *before* your experiments are done—write in parallel  
- Don’t wait for the “perfect phrasing” on first draft—just write

Don’t be afraid to revise and rewrite. Good writing is the result of multiple drafts and feedback from others. Share your work with peers or mentors for constructive criticism.

> 📌 Writing is revising. Your first draft isn’t final—it’s a map to the final.

Set small, achievable writing goals and celebrate your progress. Every paragraph brings you closer to a finished paper.

## Self-Check Questions

1. Have you read 2–3 recent papers from your target venue to mirror structure and style?
2. Do you have a clear research contribution you can articulate in 1–2 sentences?
3. Have you started drafting your Abstract and Introduction—even before results are finalized?

Reflect on these questions as you write. They’ll help you stay focused and ensure your paper is on track.

## Try This Exercise

> **Paper Skeleton Starter**  
> Open a new doc or Overleaf project and create the section headers:
>
> - Abstract  
> - 1. Introduction  
> - 2. Related Work  
> - 3. Methodology  
> - 4. Results  
> - 5. Conclusion and Future Work  
> - References  
>
> Then write **one bullet point** under each header. That’s your first outline.

Expand your outline gradually, turning bullet points into sentences and sections. Don’t worry about perfection—focus on getting your ideas down first.

## Researcher’s Compass

You don’t need to be an expert writer to publish your first paper.  
You just need to:

Writing is a process of discovery. As you draft and revise, you’ll clarify your thinking and strengthen your arguments. Be patient with yourself and trust the process.

- Understand the structure  
- Write clearly and honestly  
- Revise with feedback  
- Follow the formatting rules

> And most importantly: **Start writing before you feel ready.**  
> Research doesn’t become real until you’ve put it on the page.

Every published paper started as a rough draft. The sooner you begin, the sooner you’ll see your research take shape.
