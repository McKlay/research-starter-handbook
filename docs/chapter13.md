# Chapter 13: Writing Your First Research Paper

> *“A great paper doesn’t just report results—it tells a clear, credible story of discovery.”*

---

## Why This Chapter Matters

Writing your first research paper is intimidating.  
There’s the structure, the formatting, the references, the figures—and the invisible voice in your head whispering: *“Am I doing this right?”*

This chapter is here to quiet that voice.

We’ll walk you through the anatomy of a research paper, explain what goes where (and why), and show you how to go from raw notes and experiments to a polished, submission-ready manuscript.

## Conceptual Breakdown

**🔹 The IMRaD Structure: Your Default Template**

Most computer science research papers follow this core format:

| Section       | Purpose                                                          |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Introduction** | State the problem, why it matters, and your core contribution |
| **Methodology**  | Explain what you did, how, and why you did it that way        |
| **Results**      | Present your findings with tables, charts, and comparisons    |
| **Discussion/Conclusion** | Reflect on what your results mean, limitations, future work |

Some papers also include a **Related Work** section (usually near the intro) and an **Abstract** at the very beginning.

> 📌 Tip: Read 2–3 papers from your target venue and mimic their structure closely.

**🔹 What Goes Into Each Section?**

### **Abstract**
- A summary of your entire paper in ~150–250 words  
- Should answer: What problem? What method? What result? Why it matters?

### **Introduction**
- Hook the reader: Why is this problem important?  
- Define the gap in prior work  
- State your objective and main contribution clearly

### **Related Work**
- Summarize key prior studies and how your work builds upon or differs from them  
- Use citations strategically to position your work

### **Methodology**
- Describe your approach, system design, dataset, experimental setup  
- Be clear enough that someone could reproduce your work

### **Results**
- Show your findings with tables, graphs, metrics  
- Compare against baselines or prior work when possible

### **Conclusion**
- Restate what you achieved  
- Mention limitations and suggest future work  
- End with a strong takeaway message

**🔹 Common Formatting Styles: ACM and IEEE**

Most CS venues will ask you to submit in a specific format.

| Format | Where It's Used | Tools Available               |
|--------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| **IEEE**  | Engineering and many AI conferences | LaTeX template, Word template on IEEE author center |
| **ACM**   | SIG conferences (CHI, SIGIR, SIGCOMM, etc.) | ACM Primary Article Template (Word + LaTeX)          |

> ✅ Always start with the **official template** of your target venue. Never try to format from scratch.

**🔹 Helpful Writing Tips for Beginners**

- Use **active voice** where possible  
  > e.g., “We trained a CNN model…” instead of “A CNN model was trained…”

- Keep sentences short and precise  
- Use **section headers** to break up the narrative  
- Start writing *before* your experiments are done—write in parallel  
- Don’t wait for the “perfect phrasing” on first draft—just write

> 📌 Writing is revising. Your first draft isn’t final—it’s a map to the final.

---

## Self-Check Questions

1. Have you read 2–3 recent papers from your target venue to mirror structure and style?
2. Do you have a clear research contribution you can articulate in 1–2 sentences?
3. Have you started drafting your Abstract and Introduction—even before results are finalized?

## Try This Exercise

> **Paper Skeleton Starter**  
> Open a new doc or Overleaf project and create the section headers:
>
> - Abstract  
> - 1. Introduction  
> - 2. Related Work  
> - 3. Methodology  
> - 4. Results  
> - 5. Conclusion and Future Work  
> - References  
>
> Then write **one bullet point** under each header. That’s your first outline.

## Researcher’s Compass

You don’t need to be an expert writer to publish your first paper.  
You just need to:

- Understand the structure  
- Write clearly and honestly  
- Revise with feedback  
- Follow the formatting rules

> And most importantly: **Start writing before you feel ready.**  
> Research doesn’t become real until you’ve put it on the page.
