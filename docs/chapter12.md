# Chapter 12: Writing the Related Work Section

> *“You don’t just cite papers to check a box. You cite to tell a story—where your work fits, what it adds, and what it challenges.”*

---

## Why This Chapter Matters

You’ve read the papers. You’ve taken the notes.  
Now comes the hard part: turning all of that into a coherent **Related Work** section.

The Related Work section is your chance to demonstrate your understanding of the field and to position your research within it. A well-crafted narrative not only shows that you’ve done your homework, but also helps reviewers and readers see the value and originality of your work. This section can make the difference between a paper that gets accepted and one that gets overlooked.

This section is more than a list of citations—it’s a narrative. A map. A justification for why your research matters.  
And if it’s well written, it can convince reviewers and advisors that your work is thoughtful, original, and grounded.

Think of this section as the bridge between what’s been done and what you are about to do. It’s where you show that you’re not reinventing the wheel, but building on a solid foundation—and that you know exactly where your work fits.

But many students fall into common traps:

- Writing summaries with no connection  
- Listing papers without analysis  
- Forgetting to explain how their own work is *different*

Avoiding these traps will help you write a section that is both informative and persuasive. Remember, your goal is to synthesize, not just summarize.

This chapter will help you turn your research reading into a structured, compelling Related Work section.

## Conceptual Breakdown

**🔹 What is the Purpose of a Related Work Section?**

- To **situate** your work in the context of existing research  
- To show you understand the **state of the art**  
- To identify **gaps** or **limitations** in current work  
- To justify **why your approach is needed**

This section is also a place to acknowledge the contributions of others and to show that you are aware of ongoing debates, challenges, and open questions in your field.

> ✍️ Think of it as answering this question:  
> “What have others done—and what’s still missing?”

Your answer to this question should lead directly to your research question or hypothesis.

**🔹 From Notes to Narrative: How to Start**

You already have structured notes (see Chapter 8) and possibly a literature matrix (see Chapter 9).

Don’t be afraid to revise your groups as you read more papers or as your understanding deepens. The structure of your Related Work section should serve your argument, not the other way around.

Now, follow this process:

1. **Group your papers** by theme, method, or problem  
   - Example: “Rule-based approaches,” “Transformer-based models,” “Philippine legal NLP”  
2. **Summarize trends** and insights per group  
   - What’s been tried? What worked? What didn’t?  
3. **Position your work** at the end of each group  
   - “Unlike prior work that focused on X, our method explores Y…”

This approach helps you build a logical flow and makes it easy for readers to see how your work advances the field.

**🔹 Thematic vs. Chronological Structure**

| Structure      | When to Use It                                    |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Thematic**   | Most common; groups papers by topic or method     |
| **Chronological** | Useful when showing the evolution of a technique |
| **Hybrid**     | For complex topics with both method and time aspects|

Choose the structure that best highlights the novelty and relevance of your work. Thematic organization is usually preferred, but don’t hesitate to use a hybrid approach if it clarifies your argument.

> 🧠 Reviewers prefer thematic unless time-based progression is essential to your contribution.

Check recent papers in your target venue to see which structure is most common.

**🔹 How Many Citations Are Enough?**

There’s no perfect number—but aim for **depth, not volume**.

Focus on citing the most relevant and influential works. Too many citations can dilute your message, while too few can make your work seem disconnected from the field.

- **For a thesis**: ~30–60 focused citations across multiple sections  
- **For a short paper**: ~10–20 highly relevant works  
- Always prioritize **quality over quantity**

> ❌ Don’t cite papers you haven’t read  
> ✅ Don’t cite just because they’re popular

Every citation should serve a purpose—either to support your claims, highlight a gap, or contrast with your approach.

---

**🔹 What to Say (and What Not To)**

Do:

Use comparison and critique to show your understanding. Explain not just what others did, but why it matters and how it relates to your work.

- Compare and contrast works (not just describe them)  
- Show how your approach builds on or deviates from others  
- Acknowledge overlaps and shared challenges  

Don’t:

Avoid vague praise or generic statements. Be specific about strengths, weaknesses, and how your work addresses open questions.

- List papers like a bibliography dump  
- Praise every method without critique  
- Forget to say how your work is *new*

---

## Self-Check Questions

1. Have you grouped the papers thematically (or by methodology, domain, etc.)?
2. Are you clearly stating how your work differs or improves upon existing ones?
3. Does your narrative build toward the need for your research?

Reflect on your draft and ask a peer or advisor for feedback. A fresh perspective can help you spot gaps or unclear arguments.

## Try This Exercise

> **Related Work Builder Prompt**  
> Choose one research theme (e.g., transformer-based models for legal text). For each key paper:

- What problem did they solve?
- What method did they use?
- What limitation did they encounter?
- How does your work address or extend this?

This exercise will help you move from isolated notes to a connected narrative. As you write, look for ways to link papers together and to your own research question.

Now write a 2–3 sentence comparison per paper. String them together—this is your first draft.

Revise your draft for clarity, flow, and logical progression. Make sure each paragraph leads naturally to the next and builds your case for why your work is needed.

## Researcher’s Compass

The Related Work section is your opportunity to *frame the conversation*—to show that your research doesn’t exist in a vacuum.

A strong Related Work section demonstrates your expertise and helps reviewers trust your judgment. It also provides a roadmap for future researchers who want to build on your work.

Instead, it stands **on top of**, **next to**, or even **in contrast to** the work of others.

> Tell the story of where research has been.  
> Then show why your contribution is the next step forward.

Let your Related Work section be both a map and a springboard—showing where the field has been and where you are taking it next.
