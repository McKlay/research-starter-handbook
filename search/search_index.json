They were impactful. They didn\u2019t just align with my skills. They aligned with my values.</p> <p>So this book is more than a set of academic tips. It\u2019s both: - A map for navigating the research ecosystem (when no one teaches you how). - And a record of what it means to evolve\u2014from vague interest to focused impact.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve ever felt lost choosing a topic, confused by academic structures, or frustrated with the lack of guidance\u2014this handbook is for you.</p>"},{"location":"Preface/#who-should-read-this","title":"Who Should Read This","text":"<p>This handbook is for:</p> <ul> <li>\ud83c\udf93 Graduate students\u2014especially those in technical or interdisciplinary programs\u2014who feel like they were thrown into the deep end without learning how to swim.</li> <li>\ud83d\udd0d Early-stage researchers trying to explore literature, validate their problem space, and understand what has already been done.</li> <li>\ud83e\udde0 Self-taught builders transitioning into the academic world of conferences, journals, and research ethics.</li> <li>\ud83d\udcbc Professionals writing a thesis after years of software development, seeking clarity without getting buried in jargon.</li> </ul> <p>You don\u2019t need a PhD mindset to use this guide.
