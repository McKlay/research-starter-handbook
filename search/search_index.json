I wrote this for the student who feels overwhelmed by the academic maze, for the builder who wants to make an impact but doesn\u2019t know where to start, and for anyone who wishes someone had just explained the basics, step by step.</p> <p>As a new researcher in a Master\u2019s program, I expected guidance on how to \u201cdo research.\u201d Instead, I found myself lost in a maze of unfamiliar terms\u2014journals, conferences, venues, citations, impact factors\u2014without a map, compass, or even a starting point. No one taught us how to find actual research papers. Or how to tell if something was peer-reviewed. Or how to explore what others have already built in our chosen topic.</p> <p>The academic world can feel like it\u2019s full of hidden rules and unspoken expectations. I remember the frustration of searching for a single credible paper, the anxiety of not knowing if my sources were legitimate, and the embarrassment of asking \u201cbasic\u201d questions that everyone else seemed to already know. If you\u2019ve felt this way, you\u2019re not alone.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t know what I didn\u2019t know. And that\u2019s the most dangerous kind of blind spot.</p> <p>This book is my attempt to shine a light on those blind spots, to make the invisible visible, and to give you the confidence to ask better questions and find better answers.</p> <p>At the same time, I was wrestling with a bigger question:  </p> <p>\u201cWhat topic should I pursue for my thesis?\u201d</p> <p>That question haunted me for months. I cycled through ideas, doubted my choices, and worried about picking the \u201cwrong\u201d path. But every misstep taught me something valuable about the research process\u2014and about myself.</p> <p>I started where I felt most inspired\u2014drones and computer vision. I imagined autonomous systems, smart agriculture, and embedded AI. I built vision projects. I learned CNNs. But then reality hit: it was expensive, hardware-dependent, and logistically hard to execute without institutional resources. So I humbled myself\u2014and pivoted.</p> <p>The journey from inspiration to execution is rarely a straight line. It\u2019s full of pivots, setbacks, and unexpected discoveries. What matters is not how quickly you find your topic, but how honestly you engage with the process.</p> <p>I turned to Natural Language Processing, where everything could be built and tested in software alone. What began as a practical decision became a purpose-driven mission. I created intelligent chatbots. I built multi-modal apps like ScanlyAI. And then, I had my breakthrough moment:</p> <p>Sometimes, the best direction is the one that emerges from constraints. When resources are limited, creativity flourishes. My shift to NLP wasn\u2019t just about convenience\u2014it was about finding a way to make a real difference with the tools I had.</p> <p>AI can serve society\u2014not just impress it.</p> <p>This insight crystallized into two thesis directions:</p> <ul> <li>AI-Powered Legal Aid Chatbot \u2013 Bringing access to justice closer to everyday Filipinos.</li> <li>AI-Powered Transparency Assistant \u2013 Letting citizens query government budgets and audit reports conversationally.</li> </ul> <p>These weren\u2019t just feasible. They were impactful. They didn\u2019t just align with my skills. They aligned with my values.</p> <p>Impact is what transforms research from an academic exercise into a meaningful pursuit. When your work aligns with your values, motivation follows naturally\u2014even when the work gets hard.</p> <p>So this book is more than a set of academic tips. It\u2019s both: - A map for navigating the research ecosystem (when no one teaches you how). - And a record of what it means to evolve\u2014from vague interest to focused impact.</p> <p>You\u2019ll find practical advice, hard-won lessons, and encouragement to keep going when things get messy. My hope is that this book will be the companion I wish I\u2019d had\u2014a guide, a reference, and a source of reassurance.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve ever felt lost choosing a topic, confused by academic structures, or frustrated with the lack of guidance, this handbook is for you.</p> <p>You don\u2019t have to have it all figured out.

The process of sifting through ideas, questioning assumptions, and wrestling with ambiguity is what sharpens your thinking. In fact, some of the most innovative research projects began as vague questions or half-formed interests.

The only wrong move is rushing a decision you don\u2019t yet understand.</p> <p>\ud83d\udd39 How I Got Lost (and Found Direction) Here\u2019s a real story. I started with Computer Vision, pivoted to NLP, then landed on AI for Public Service.

But with every pivot, I gained new skills, met new mentors, and discovered aspects of research I hadn\u2019t considered before. The journey was not linear, and at times, I doubted my choices. Looking back, those moments of doubt were actually moments of learning. They forced me to reflect on what truly mattered to me, and to seek out communities and resources that aligned with my evolving interests.</p> <p>You don\u2019t need to commit to your first interest. You just need to start exploring.</p> <p>\ud83d\udd39 Your Journey Is Not a Straight Line Most great researchers did not \u201cknow\u201d their final topic from the beginning. They arrived there by:</p> <ul> <li>Reading broadly</li> <li>Trying small experiments</li> <li>Talking to others</li> <li>Listening to what problems made them feel something</li> </ul> <p>It\u2019s important to recognize that research is rarely a solitary pursuit. Collaboration, discussion, and feedback are essential. Don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to professors, attend seminars, or join study groups. Sometimes, a casual conversation can open doors to new fields or clarify your thinking. The path may twist and turn, but every experience adds to your toolkit as a researcher.</p> <p>Research is not just technical.

Take time to journal your thoughts, discuss them with mentors, or even debate them with friends. The answers may not come immediately, but the act of asking is itself a step toward clarity.

You might design a new database, build a robotics platform, or develop a novel networking protocol. The work is often collaborative, involving teams and iterative testing. Success is measured by whether your system works, scales, and solves real problems.</p> </li> <li> <p>Theory research is about deep thinking and abstraction. You\u2019ll spend time with mathematical proofs, logic, and complexity. The work is solitary at times, but also involves lively debates and peer review. Success is measured by the elegance and rigor of your results, and their impact on how we understand computation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Empirical research is investigative. You\u2019ll design experiments, collect data, and analyze results. This could mean running user studies, benchmarking algorithms, or evaluating new technologies in the field. Success is measured by the quality of your evidence and the insights you uncover about real-world behavior.</p> </li> </ul> Type What It Focuses On Common Output Systems Building working software/hardware Frameworks, tools, protocols, datasets Theory Proving things mathematically Lemmas, theorems, complexity classes Empirical Testing and observing real-world behavior Experiments, user studies, evaluations <p>Each has a different culture of proof, writing, and publication.</p> <p>For example, a systems paper might include code and performance benchmarks, while a theory paper focuses on definitions and proofs. Empirical work often features charts, statistics, and discussion of limitations. Learning to recognize these cultures will help you read papers more effectively and communicate your own work.</p> <p>\ud83d\udd39 Applied vs. Fundamental vs. Exploratory</p> <p>This is another lens to examine your direction:</p> <p>These categories are not rigid boxes. Many projects blend applied, fundamental, and exploratory elements. For instance, you might start with an exploratory idea, develop a fundamental understanding, and then apply it to solve a real problem. The key is to notice which questions excite you most\u2014do you want to build, understand, or discover?</p> Type Key Question Example Topic Applied \u201cHow can we use this to solve X?\u201d Using AI to predict floods Fundamental \u201cWhat are the limits or properties of Y?\u201d Proving limits of cryptographic hash Exploratory \u201cWhat happens if we try Z?\u201d Visualizing large language model errors <p>You can mix and match. Some applied work has theoretical backing. Some exploratory work becomes the seed of a new applied method.</p> <p>\ud83d\udd39 Quantitative vs. Qualitative Methods</p> <p>CS isn't only about numbers.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Quantitative research includes benchmarks, metrics, statistical tests, ML model performance, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p>Qualitative research includes interviews, thematic analysis, user feedback, open coding, etc.</p> </li> </ul> <p>HCI (Human-Computer Interaction), ICT4D (Tech for Development), and EdTech often use both.</p> <p>Choosing your method depends on your research question. If you want to measure how fast an algorithm runs, you\u2019ll use quantitative methods. If you want to understand how people feel about a new technology, qualitative methods are essential. Many impactful projects combine both, using numbers to show what\u2019s happening and stories to explain why.</p> <p>Don\u2019t assume \u201creal research\u201d only means code and math.
