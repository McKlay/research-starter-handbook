No one taught us how to find actual research papers. Or how to tell if something was peer-reviewed. Or how to explore what others have already built in our chosen topic.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t know what I didn\u2019t know.

I imagined autonomous systems, smart agriculture, and embedded AI. I built vision projects. I learned CNNs. But then reality hit: it was expensive, hardware-dependent, and logistically hard to execute without institutional resources. So I humbled myself\u2014and pivoted.</p> <p>I turned to Natural Language Processing, where everything could be built and tested in software alone.

They were impactful. They didn\u2019t just align with my skills. They aligned with my values.</p> <p>So this book is more than a set of academic tips. It\u2019s both: - A map for navigating the research ecosystem (when no one teaches you how). - And a record of what it means to evolve\u2014from vague interest to focused impact.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve ever felt lost choosing a topic, confused by academic structures, or frustrated with the lack of guidance, this handbook is for you.</p>"},{"location":"Preface/#who-should-read-this","title":"Who Should Read This","text":"<p>This handbook is for:</p> <ul> <li>Graduate students\u2014especially those in technical or interdisciplinary programs who feel like they were thrown into the deep end without learning how to swim.</li> <li>Early-stage researchers trying to explore literature, validate their problem space, and understand what has already been done.</li> <li>Self-taught builders transitioning into the academic world of conferences, journals, and research ethics.</li> <li>Professionals writing a thesis after years of software development, seeking clarity without getting buried in jargon.</li> </ul> <p>You don\u2019t need a PhD mindset to use this guide.

The uncertainty you feel is shared by even the most experienced researchers, and it is often the spark that leads to genuine insight.</p> <p>No one tells you how wide, deep, and multidimensional computer science research really is\u2014until you\u2019re dropped right into it.

The process of sifting through ideas, questioning assumptions, and wrestling with ambiguity is what sharpens your thinking. In fact, some of the most innovative research projects began as vague questions or half-formed interests. Embrace this stage as a time to gather inspiration, not to judge your progress.</p> <p>This stage is part of the journey. The only wrong move is rushing a decision you don\u2019t yet understand.</p> <p>\ud83d\udd39 How I Got Lost (and Found Direction) Here\u2019s a real story. I started with Computer Vision, pivoted to NLP, then landed on AI for Public Service. Each shift taught me something:</p> <ul> <li>Computer Vision showed me what excites me (seeing things work visually)</li> <li>NLP revealed my love for language, structure, and real-world relevance</li> <li>AI for Governance let me anchor tech to a social impact mission</li> </ul> <p>Each transition was marked by uncertainty and a sense of starting over. But with every pivot, I gained new skills, met new mentors, and discovered aspects of research I hadn\u2019t considered before. The journey was not linear, and at times, I doubted my choices. Looking back, those moments of doubt were actually moments of learning. They forced me to reflect on what truly mattered to me, and to seek out communities and resources that aligned with my evolving interests.</p> <p>You don\u2019t need to commit to your first interest. You just need to start exploring.</p> <p>\ud83d\udd39 Your Journey Is Not a Straight Line Most great researchers did not \u201cknow\u201d their final topic from the beginning. They arrived there by:</p> <ul> <li>Reading broadly</li> <li>Trying small experiments</li> <li>Talking to others</li> <li>Listening to what problems made them feel something</li> </ul> <p>It\u2019s important to recognize that research is rarely a solitary pursuit. Collaboration, discussion, and feedback are essential. Don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to professors, attend seminars, or join study groups. Sometimes, a casual conversation can open doors to new fields or clarify your thinking. The path may twist and turn, but every experience adds to your toolkit as a researcher.</p> <p>Research is not just technical. It\u2019s emotional, reflective, and personal.</p> <p>\ud83d\udd39 The Inner Questions That Matter Instead of asking:</p> <ul> <li>\u201cWhat\u2019s trending?\u201d</li> <li>\u201cWhat\u2019s publishable?\u201d</li> <li>\u201cWhat will impress people?\u201d</li> </ul> <p>Ask:</p> <ul> <li>\u201cWhat problem do I care enough to sit with for months?\u201d</li> <li>\u201cWhat kinds of papers do I find fascinating\u2014even before I understand them fully?\u201d</li> <li>\u201cWhat would I be proud to work on, even if it fails?\u201d</li> </ul> <p>These questions are designed to help you dig deeper into your motivations. Take time to journal your thoughts, discuss them with mentors, or even debate them with friends. The answers may not come immediately, but the act of asking is itself a step toward clarity.

You might design a new database, build a robotics platform, or develop a novel networking protocol. The work is often collaborative, involving teams and iterative testing. Success is measured by whether your system works, scales, and solves real problems.</p> </li> <li> <p>Theory research is about deep thinking and abstraction. You\u2019ll spend time with mathematical proofs, logic, and complexity. The work is solitary at times, but also involves lively debates and peer review. Success is measured by the elegance and rigor of your results, and their impact on how we understand computation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Empirical research is investigative. You\u2019ll design experiments, collect data, and analyze results. This could mean running user studies, benchmarking algorithms, or evaluating new technologies in the field. Success is measured by the quality of your evidence and the insights you uncover about real-world behavior.</p> </li> </ul> Type What It Focuses On Common Output Systems Building working software/hardware Frameworks, tools, protocols, datasets Theory Proving things mathematically Lemmas, theorems, complexity classes Empirical Testing and observing real-world behavior Experiments, user studies, evaluations <p>Each has a different culture of proof, writing, and publication.</p> <p>For example, a systems paper might include code and performance benchmarks, while a theory paper focuses on definitions and proofs. Empirical work often features charts, statistics, and discussion of limitations. Learning to recognize these cultures will help you read papers more effectively and communicate your own work.</p> <p>\ud83d\udd39 Applied vs. Fundamental vs. Exploratory</p> <p>This is another lens to examine your direction:</p> <p>These categories are not rigid boxes. Many projects blend applied, fundamental, and exploratory elements. For instance, you might start with an exploratory idea, develop a fundamental understanding, and then apply it to solve a real problem. The key is to notice which questions excite you most\u2014do you want to build, understand, or discover?</p> Type Key Question Example Topic Applied \u201cHow can we use this to solve X?\u201d Using AI to predict floods Fundamental \u201cWhat are the limits or properties of Y?\u201d Proving limits of cryptographic hash Exploratory \u201cWhat happens if we try Z?\u201d Visualizing large language model errors <p>You can mix and match. Some applied work has theoretical backing. Some exploratory work becomes the seed of a new applied method.</p> <p>\ud83d\udd39 Quantitative vs. Qualitative Methods</p> <p>CS isn't only about numbers.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Quantitative research includes benchmarks, metrics, statistical tests, ML model performance, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p>Qualitative research includes interviews, thematic analysis, user feedback, open coding, etc.</p> </li> </ul> <p>HCI (Human-Computer Interaction), ICT4D (Tech for Development), and EdTech often use both.</p> <p>Choosing your method depends on your research question. If you want to measure how fast an algorithm runs, you\u2019ll use quantitative methods. If you want to understand how people feel about a new technology, qualitative methods are essential. Many impactful projects combine both, using numbers to show what\u2019s happening and stories to explain why.</p> <p>Don\u2019t assume \u201creal research\u201d only means code and math.

You\u2019ll need to learn the language of other fields, build relationships, and adapt your methods. The payoff is the chance to make a real difference in society.
